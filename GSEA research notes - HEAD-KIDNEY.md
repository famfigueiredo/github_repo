# Interpretation of GSEA Results

From ChatGPT when prompted to explain a negative *Normalised Enrichment Score* (NES):

*In summary, a negative NES in GSEA indicates that the gene set is significantly downregulated in the condition of interest compared to the control, reflecting a negative correlation with the phenotype being studied. This information can provide valuable insights into the biological processes that are less active or suppressed in the experimental condition.*

- 

  

  Positive NES:

  - 

    Indicates that the gene set is enriched at the top of the ranked list, suggesting that genes in the set are upregulated in the condition of interest.

- 

  

  Negative NES:

  - 

    Indicates that the gene set is enriched at the bottom of the ranked list, suggesting that genes in the set are downregulated in the condition of interest.

Most studies related to viral infection use qPCR to 'measure' gene expression of target genes in relation to a *housekeeping gene*. The approach of using RNAseq as a tool to study immune responses is inherently different, in the sense that it does not compare gene expression against a housekeeping gene. Instead, it requires using a *reference*, such as a control group. This control group provides the baseline gene expression against which all other groups are compared to.

Because with RNAseq one looks at thousands of genes simultaneously, it makes more sense to have a holistic view of gene expression. Any emerging patterns in gene expression tend to stand out during pathway analysis, since pathways, by definition, incorporate hundreds, or even thousands, of differentially regulated genes.

How did you look at specific genes in the RNAseq data (genes in Table 1, for example)? Are these manually curated, and you get their respective raw counts from gene count files?
